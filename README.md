predict_concurrence_or_MI.ipynb
</h1>
The jupyter notebook file predict_concurrence_or_MI.ipynb contain a code where you can estimate the value of concurrence or mutual information
in the system of two qubits with our trained neural networks. The code contain also the maximum likelihood algorithm for the comparion.


<h1>
netTraining_measurement_specific_DNNs.py /
netTraining_meaurement_independent_DNN.py
</h1>
These python codes serve as a tool for reproducing the results for both types of neural networks.
